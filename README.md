* Arduino Leonardo: Basically Ardunio Boards are the microcontroller platform which gives easy of communication between the hardware and the softwre. We can easily do the hardware comnections and can easily code the necessary code for the projects. Arduino Leonardo is one of the type of hardware-software platform which is based in on the ATmega32u4. This board inculdes 20 digital I/O pins and a crystall oscillator of 16MHz frequency. In the 20 I/O ports 12 pins work as analog inputs and 7 pins are Pulse width modulation outputs.It also includes a USB connection, a power jack, reset pin and the ICSP header.It can be switch on with the help of the adaptor and also by connceting it to the computer through USB cable.
