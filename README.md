### How to talk to computers
#### Introduction to QFN-48 PAckage,Chip,Pads,core,die and IPs
* Arduino Leonardo: Basically Ardunio Boards are the microcontroller platform which gives easy of communication between the hardware and the softwre. We can easily do the hardware comnections and can easily code the necessary code for the projects. Arduino Leonardo is one of the type of hardware-software platform which is based in on the ATmega32u4. This board inculdes 20 digital I/O pins and a crystall oscillator of 16MHz frequency. In the 20 I/O ports 12 pins work as analog inputs and 7 pins are Pulse width modulation outputs.It also includes a USB connection, a power jack, reset pin and the ICSP header.It can be switch on with the help of the adaptor and also by connceting it to the computer through USB cable. ![arduino-leonardo-board1](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/14ffae04-199f-42d1-9a83-454208820a4a)
  
Our objective of this course mainly deals with the chips or the processor as mentioned with the square box in the above picture.
* Peripherals of the chip/processor :Across the chip/processor we will be able to see many more interface conncetion across the board as show in the below picture![processor](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/7d796770-de7a-48b5-9f12-0bb894ed8765)

Processor ha sbeen connected to many more interfaces such as to the JTAG UART which helps in the communication between the external devices without the mediating devices such as RS-232.Also it will be connceted to the SDRAM for the Memory ,Flash,Voltage connection,Ground,ADC etc.
