#### Introduction to QFN-48 PAckage,Chip,Pads,core,die and IPs
* Arduino Leonardo:
  Basically Ardunio Boards are the microcontroller platform which gives easy of communication between the hardware and the softwre. We can easily do the hardware comnections and can easily code the necessary code for the projects. Arduino Leonardo is one of the type of hardware-software platform which is based in on the ATmega32u4. This board inculdes 20 digital I/O pins and a crystall oscillator of 16MHz frequency. In the 20 I/O ports 12 pins work as analog inputs and 7 pins are Pulse width modulation outputs.It also includes a USB connection, a power jack, reset pin and the ICSP header.It can be switch on with the help of the adaptor and also by connceting it to the computer through USB cable. ![arduino-leonardo-board1](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/14ffae04-199f-42d1-9a83-454208820a4a)
  Our objective of this course mainly deals with the chips or the processor as mentioned with the square box in the above picture.
  
* Peripherals of the chip/processor :
  Across the chip/processor we will be able to see many more interface conncetion across the board as show in the below picture![processor](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/80568241-de26-4f3e-b6de-22bfa06ff785)

  Processor has been connected to many more interfaces such as to the JTAG UART which helps in the communication between the external devices without the mediating devices such as RS-232.Also it will be connceted to the SDRAM for the Memory,Flash,Voltage connection,Ground,ADC etc.

* Packages : IC Packages protect the semiconductor devices and components and helps in the integration of the IC with the electronic devices. There are different types of packages such as:
  * Through hole Packages: It is the type of package where 1 or more leads go through holes of PCB and gets connected using the solder.The other types in this are
    - SIP(Single In Line Package)
    - DIP(Double In Line Package)
    - PGA(Pin Grid Array)
      
  * Surface Mount Packages: This is the Package where the external devices are mounted on the PCB board.The most common technique used in this type are
     - QFN(Quad Flat No-Lead):These are compact sized,the model QFN-48 has 48 pins in it where the chip will be having pins in all the 4 sides.In the below figure we can see the QFN-48 packaged chip![pp](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/ff015b50-e362-46cd-832e-5575ae7b8cab)
     - Ball Grid Array : Instead of leads in this we use metall balls to create the respective connection
       
  * Contact Less Packages: In this type there will be no physical connection between the PCM.

Inside the chip there is a Square Patch which has been divided into many regions as shown in the figure![fo](https://github.com/Akshay-Bhargav/soc-design-program/assets/168112516/0a1e9cc7-07c5-4c7d-93ad-daba667dd01f)

* Core : Area inside the chip where all the digital logic takes places with the help of the digital ciruits with in it.
*  Pads : Pads are the medium through wich the input and output signals has to pass.
*  Die : Small block of semiconducting materials on which the Pads has been built and mainly refers to the cornors of Square patch.
*   Foundry IP's : Foundry will helps in providing the essential building block for the chip design,allowing the designer to leverage pre-designed components optimized for specific purpose technologies.
